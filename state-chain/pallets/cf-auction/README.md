# Chainflip Auction Module

A module to manage auctions for the Chainflip State Chain

- [`Config`]
- [`Call`]
- [`Module`]

## Overview

The module contains functionality to run a contest or auction in which a set of bidders are provided via
the `BidderProvider` trait. Calling `process()` we push forward the state of our auction. First we are looking
for `Bidders` with which we validate their suitability for the next phase `Auction`. During this phase we run an auction
which selects a list of winners sets a minimum bid of what was need to get in the winning list and set the state
to `Completed`. The caller would then finally call `process()` to clear the auction in which it would move to
`Bidders` waiting for the next auction to be started. At any point in time the auction can be aborted returning state
to `Bidders`

## Terminology
