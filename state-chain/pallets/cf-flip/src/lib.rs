#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std)]

//! Flip Token Pallet
//!
//! Loosely based on Parity's Balances pallet.
//!
//! Provides some low-level helpers for creating balance updates that maintain the accounting of funds.
//!
//! Exposes higher-level operations via the [cf_traits::StakeTransfer] and [cf_traits::Emissions] traits.
//!
//! ## Imbalances
//!
//! Imbalances are not very intuitive but the idea is this: if you want to manipulate the balance of FLIP in the
//! system, there always need to be two equal and opposite [Imbalance]s. Any excess is reverted according to the
//! implementation of [imbalances::RevertImbalance] when the imbalance is dropped.
//!
//! A [Deficit] means that there is an excess of funds *in the accounts* that needs to be reconciled. Either we have
//! credited some funds to an account, or we have debited funds from some external source without putting them anywhere.
//! Think of it like this: if we credit an account, we need to pay for it somehow. Either by debiting from another, or
//! by minting some tokens, or by bridging them from outside (aka. staking).
//!
//! A [Surplus] is (unsurprisingly) the opposite: it means there is an excess of funds *outside of the accounts*. Maybe
//! an account has been debited some amount, or we have minted some tokens. These to be allocated somewhere.
//!
//! ### Example
//!
//! A [burn](Pallet::burn) creates a [Deficit]: the total issuance has been reduced so we need a [Surplus] from
//! somewhere that we can offset against this. Usually, we want to debit an account to burn (slash) funds. We may also
//! want to burn funds that are held in trading pools, for example. In this case we might withdraw from a pool to create
//! a surplus to offset the burn (not implemented yet).
//!
//! If the [Deficit] created by the burn goes out of scope without being offset, the change is reverted, effectively
//! minting the tokens and adding them back to the total issuance.
