# Chainflip Environment Pallet

## Purpose

This pallet manages general global config items of the protocol. Currently, the following config elements are supported:

- StakeManagerAddress
- KeyManagerAddress
- EthereumChainId

Every config item has a default value set on genesis. Moreover, it's possible to
upgrade the values via an runtime upgrade.
