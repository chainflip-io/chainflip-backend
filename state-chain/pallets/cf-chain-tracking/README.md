# Chainflip Chain Tracking Pallet

This is a pallet for tracking the state of other chains.

## Purpose

We use this pallet to notarise our latest view of external chain states.

The notarised chain state differs for each chain. For example, for Ethereum we are interested in block height and current gas fees.

### Genesis Configuration

None required.
