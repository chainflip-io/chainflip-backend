/// A trait for implementing state machines, in particular used for electoral systems.
///
/// See also the documentation for `StatemachineElectoralSystem`.
///
/// An electoral system is essentialy a state machine: it keeps track of an internal state,
/// processes votes as input, and produces a result in every `on_finalize` call.
///
/// Thus the basic structure is that we have three associated types:
///  - `State`
///  - `Input`
///  - `Output` and a function `step(&mut State, Input) -> Output`.
///
/// NOTE: Due to ergonomic reasons, we have another associated type `Settings` which has the same
/// purpose as `Input`, but which is passed by reference to the `step` function, instead of by
/// value. It would be possible to merge these into a new struct `{input: Input, settings: &'a
/// Settings}`, and thus do away with the `Settings` associated type, but it seems to be more
/// ergonomic to keep it, as long as we only use the state machine abstraction for electoral system
/// which always have a settings component.
///
/// ## Mapping to elections
/// For an electoral system, the `Input` type is always of the form `SMInput<(Properties,
/// Consensus),Context>`, which is an `Either` type carrying either a tuple consisting of election
/// properties and consensus or alternatively the type of the `OnFinalizeContext`.
///
/// The `InputIndex` type is a vector of election properties, the function `input_index()` computes
/// to each state the properties of all elections that should be open for this state. This means
/// that creation of elections is handled indirectly: The state machine merely has to transition
/// into a state with the correct `input_index`, all elections with these election properties is
/// going to be created automatically, and potentially ongoing elections which are not in the
/// `input_index` are going to be deleted.
///
/// The `step` function takes as input the current state, settings, and an input, and computes the
/// next state, as well as a result. The input is either the consensus gained in some election which
/// was open, or alternatively the `OnFinalizeContext` which is being passed to this ES from another
/// ES upstream.   
///
/// ## Multiple elections
/// The `step` function is designed as the smallest logical state transition of the ES. Thus it
/// takes as input only a single consensus *or* a single context. Thus, during a typical
/// `on_finalize` call, the `step` function is called multiple times, once for each available input.
/// The outputs of each `step` call are collected into a vector and passed to the next ES.
///
/// ## Validation
/// It is common to have certain validity requirements which one assumes to hold for either
/// the input, state, or output. These are encoded by `Validate` bounds
/// on the `Output` and `State` type, as well as an `AbstractApi` bound on
/// `Self`. The latter allows a tuple of (Query, Response) to be checked for validity: i.e., given
/// an query, and a response, we not only check that they are individually well formed, but we also
/// ensure that the response is valid *for a given query*.
///
/// For example, in the BlockHeightWitnesser, elections are created to witness block headers
/// starting from a given height, in that case we can ensure that the received vector of block
/// headers actually starts with the correct height.
///
/// ## Testing
/// The state machine trait provides a convenience method `test(states, settings, inputs)` for
/// testing a given state machine. Here `states`, `settings` and `inputs` are strategies for
/// generating states, settings and inputs, and the function runs the `step` function on randomly
/// generated input values, while ensuring that all inputs and outputs are valid as per .
///
/// Additionally the `step_specification` function can be implemented, in order to provide custom
/// pre-/postconditions to be checked during `test()`.
