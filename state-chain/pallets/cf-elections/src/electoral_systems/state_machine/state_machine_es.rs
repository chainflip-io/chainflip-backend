/// ### Electoral system derived from a state machine.
///
/// In order to derive such an electoral system (ES), the following steps have to be taken:
///
/// 1. Create a new "tag type" for the ES, whose purpose it is to carry the implementation of
///    various traits and their associated types. This type is only relevant at compile time and
///    should not contain any runtime data. You'll need to implement various common traits for it
///    (`Debug`, `Clone`, `Serialize`, `TypeInfo`, `Encode`, etc.), which you can either do by hand,
///    or use a convenience wrapper such as `TypesFor<_>`. Let's call this tag type `ES`.
///
/// 2. Implement the traits `ElectoralSystemTypes` and `StatemachineElectoralSystemTypes` for your
///    tag type. As you can see in the definition, the latter trait depends on the former, but with
///    various conditions on the associated types. This means that you are not totally free in
///    choosing all the associated types, but have to follow these conditions. For instance, both
///    `OnFinalizeContext` and `OnFinalizeReturn` have to be of type `Vec<_>`.
///
/// 3. You'll find that in the previous step you have to choose associated types `Statemachine` and
///    `ConsensusMechanism`. If you want to implement a new state machine and/or a new consensus
///    mechanism, you'll have to do either of the following (ES refers to the tag type you created
///    in step 1):
///     - Create a new tag type for the state machine, and implement the trait
///       `StatemachineForES<ES>`.
///     - Create a new tag type for the consensus mechanism, and implement the trait
///       `ConsensusMechanismForES<ES>`.
///
///    The conditions on associated types in the definitions of `StatemachineForES` and
///    `ConsensusMechanismForES` ensure that all components fit together into a coherent electoral
///    system.
///
/// 4. Enjoy your new electoral system! It is called `StatemachineElectoralSystem<ES>`, where `ES`
///    is the tag type from step 1.

/// ### Implementation of the `ElectoralSystem` trait for a given state machine and consensus mechanism.
///
/// See the documentation of `StatemachineForElectoralSystem`
/// for more information on how to assemble all components correctly.
///
/// This ES behaves as follows:
///  - `check_consensus` is delegated to the given consensus mechanism. Votes which are invalid
///    according to the `IsValid` implementation on the `ES::Vote` type are ignored.
///  - The state machine's state is stored in `ElectoralUnsynchronizedState`.
///  - During `on_finalize`, the state machine's step function is called once for each value in the
///    `OnFinalizeContext` vector, and after that, once for each election that has come to
///    consensus.
///  - The outputs of each individual `step` call are collected into a vector, in order to be
///    returned as the final `OnFinalizeReturn` result.
///  - After completing all `step` calls, the `input_index` function of the SM is called. Its result
///    is a vector of election properties. The intention is that elections for exactly these
///    properties should be active after the `on_finalize` terminates. Thus, the ES deletes all
///    elections whose corresponding election properties are not in the `input_index()` vector, and
///    creates new elections for all properties in `input_index()`, which aren't currently
///    associated with an election.
///  - Finally the state machine's new state is written back into `ElectoralUnsynchronizedState`.
///
/// WARNING:
/// Due to the fact that elections are created and deleted based solely on the `input_index()`
/// vector of election properties, this means that it might be tricky to implement "refreshing" of
/// elections in cases where the election properties don't change.
///  - It is sensible to follow the `ElectionIdentifierExtra` approach of the ES trait, and add a
///    separate counter to the election properties which can be incremented if a new election with
///    the same properties is required.
///  - Due to the fact that in a single `on_finalize` call, the `step` function might be run
///    multiple times, extra care needs to be taken to ensure that this produces the appropriate
///    behaviour of refreshing elections. For example, it might be the case that the `step` function
///    is called twice, and in the first call removes property `A` from its list of input indices,
///    and in the second call adds property `A` back again. The expected behaviour might be that the
///    election for `A` is recreated, but the current observed behaviour will be that the election
///    for `A` simply stays open - because the `input_index()` function is only called after both
///    step transitions, and thus doesn't notice that `A` got removed and added back.
///  - In the currently implemented ESs this is not a problem, but has to be checked when new state
///    machines are designed.
