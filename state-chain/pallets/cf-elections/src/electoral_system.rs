mod access {
	//! This module contains a set of interfaces used to access the details of elections. These
	//! traits abstract the underlying substrate storage items, thereby allowing ElectoralSystem's
	//! to be arbitrarily composed while still allowing each to be written in isolation, wihtout
	//! needing konwledge of how it will be composed.
	//!
	//! Also some of the storage items are lazily maintained, and so accessing them directly would
	//! provide inaccurate values. For example we don't allow access to the `Vote` details directly,
	//! which are passed directly as needed to `ElectoralSystem` trait. As the underlying storage
	//! does not strictly guarantee that all votes in the storage are from current authorities. Also
	//! this abstraction provides benefits like being able to easily test ElectoralSystem's without
	//! needing the full substrate infrastructure, and allowing cheap simulation of the existence of
	//! votes which could be useful for implementing the intended engine simulation mode.
	//!
	//! The traits in this module are split into immutable (Read) and mutable (Write) access traits,
	//! to allow the pallet to at restrict write access when it should be done, to help ensure
	//! correct ElectoralSystem implementation.
