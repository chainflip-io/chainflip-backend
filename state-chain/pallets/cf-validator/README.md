# Chainflip Validator Pallet

This pallet is responsible for managing Chainflip's validator nodes.

Validator nodes fall into different categories:

- **Authority** Nodes are responsible for block authorship, signing ceremonies and witnessing. A portion of their funds
  are bonded and may be slashed according to the reputation system. Authorities earn Flip rewards at a rate that is
  fixed for the duration of the epoch.
- **Backup** Nodes are incentivised to remain available to participate in the next keygen ceremony. Note, only the highest funded Backup nodes receive rewards, according to a ratio against the number of authorities, set in the runtime.

To qualify as a Validator Node, the following conditions must be met:

1. The node must be **funded**.
2. The node must be **bidding**.
3. The node must have registered its **session keys**.
4. The node must have registered its **peer id**.
5. The node must be **online**, which is at the time of writing means **submitting heartbeats**.

This is subject to change: for the canonical definition of node qualification, check the runtime-injected implementation
of `Config::ValidatorQualification`.

In addition, Authority nodes are split into **Current** and **Historical** Authorities. *Historical* authorities remain
bonded and may be required to participate in signing ceremonies using expiring keys. They may be slashed, but earn no
rewards, unless they happen to be among the highest funded backup nodes. However note that being a historical authority is not a prerequisite for
becoming a backup node.

Any node that fulfils the qualification conditions will be considered for inclusion in the set of backup nodes. The size
of this set is limited (as of writing, the limit is 33% of the authority set size), and prioritised according to highest
balance. Backup nodes earn rewards proportionally to their funds, at a rate that increases quadratically as their balance
approaches the current epoch's bond.

## Overview

The module contains functionality to manage the validator set used to ensure the Chainflip
State Chain network.  It extends on the functionality offered by the `session` pallet provided by
Parity. There are two types of sessions; an Epoch session in which we have a constant set of validators
and an Auction session in which we continue with our current validator set and request a set of
candidates for validation.  Once validated and confirmed become our new set of validators within the
Epoch session.

## Auctions

This pallet implements the Chainflip Authority selection process. Upon execution of the selection process, a set of Bidders, provided by the [BidderProvider] trait, have their suitability evaluated and a set winners is selected.

## Rotations

Authorities are rotated when any of three conditions are met:

1. The duration of the current epoch exceeds the target **epoch duration**.
2. The governance-gated **`force_rotation`** extrinsic is called.

The above diagram is a high-level illustration of how we resolve authority rotations. For more detail, refer to the
code. Advancement through each of the rotation phases is driven by the `on_initialize` hook.

## Terminology

- Validator: A node that has registered their account role as `Validator`.
- Validator ID: Equivalent to an Account ID
- Epoch: A period in blocks in which a constant set of validators ensure the network.
- Auction: The period during which redemptions are disabled.
- Auction Resolution: The method for resolving an auction. Based on validator's bids at the time of resolution, the
  auction resolution will determine the set of auction winners.
- Authority Candidates: The set of validator nodes that will participate in the next keygen ceremony in an attempt to
  join the next authority set. Any candidates that fail keygen are banned and replaced with candidates from the pool
  of secondary candidates.
- Primary Candidates are the auction winners.
- Secondary Candidates are a number of highest-funded auction losers. At the time of writing this number is determined
  as 1/3 the number of backup validators.
- Session: A session as defined by the `session` pallet. We have two sessions; Epoch which has
  a fixed number of blocks set with `set_blocks_for_epoch` and an Auction session which is of an
  undetermined number of blocks.
- Bidder: An entity that has placed a bid and would hope to be included in the winning set
- Winners: Those Bidders that have been evaluated and have been included in the winning set
- Minimum Bid: The minimum bid required to be included in the Winners set
- Backup Node: A group of bidders who make up a group size of ideally 1/3 of the desired authority set size.  They are expected to act as a reserve in that they are fully functioning nodes that are ready
  to become an authority during any upcoming rotation.
