# Chainflip Tokenholder Governance Pallet

## Overview

This pallet implements the current Chainflip token holder governance functionality. The purpose of this pallet is primarily to provide the following capabilities:

- Handle submitting Proposals by any on-chain account
- Handle backing Proposals by any on-chain account
- Handling the lifecycle of a Proposal from the voting to the enactment period
- Broadcasting a new GOV/COMM key after the Proposal has been enacted

### Mechanics

Any on-chain account is allowed to submit a Proposal for a new GOV key. Moreover, any on-chain account can back a submitted proposal with his available on-chain funds. A proposal is live for a configured voting period. If 2/3 of the total locked funds are backing a proposal, the proposal has passed the voting and goes into the enactment stage. After the enactment period is over, the proposal is getting executed.

### Side notes

- To submit a Proposal an account has to pay an extra fee. This fee is on top of the normal transaction cost and configurable in the runtime.
- If a new Proposal passes the voting stage before the preceding Proposal reaches the end of the enactment phase, the preceding Proposal is replaced by the new one and a new enactment period begins.

## Terminology

- Proposal: There are two types of proposal: new governance key and new community key.
- Master Governance Key (MGK): An opaque key using cryptography compatible with the Ethereum Chain, most likely based on a Gnosis Safe. Can be used for governance actions on the Ethereum Chain and for Governance Actions on the State Chain (by runtime verification of the Ethereum signature).
- Governance Key: Each chain will have its own governance key. Governance keys in general have powers over the chainâ€™s vault. An important distinction is that the MGK described above has additional powers over the FLIP token, and the state chain.
- Community Key: A cryptographic key controlled by the Chainflip community, used for governance oversight. Has the power to block certain governance actions like vault transfers.
- Ops Committee: The Ops committee can be set (and, by extension, revoked) by the MGK. The Ops Committee is represented by a list of substrate Public Keys (equivalent to AccountIds) can trigger State Chain Governance actions by 2/3 majority vote. (Equivalent to the current on-chain notion of Governance as implemented in the governance pallet).
- Token holder: An on-chain account which has any amount of FLIP funded
- Backing: The process of supporting a proposal
- VotingPeriod: The amount of time in blocks in which a Proposal is live for backing
- EnactmentPeriod: An delay in blocks between a Proposal has passed the voting and the broadcasting of the new key
