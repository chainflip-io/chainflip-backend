//! # Chainflip staking
//!
//! The responsiblities of this [pallet](Pallet) can be broken down into:
//!
//! ## Staking
//!
//! - Stake is added via the Ethereum StakeManager contract. `Staked` events emitted from this contract should trigger
//!   votes via signed calls to `witness_stake`.
//! - Any stake added in this way is considered as an implicit bid for a validator slot.
//! - If stake is added to a non-existent account, it will not be counted and will be refunded instead.
//!
//! ## Claiming
//!
//! - A claim request is made via a signed call to `claim`.
//! - The claimant who is a current validator is subject to the bond - an amount equal to the current bond is locked
//!   and cannot be claimed. For example if an account has 120 FLIP staked, and the current bond is 40 FLIP, their
//!   claimable balance would be 80 FLIP.
//! - An event is emitted with the claim parameters that need to be signed by the CFE signing module.
//! - Once a valid signature is generated, this is posted to the state chain along with the expiry timestamp.
//!
//! ## Claim expiry
//!
//! - When a claim expires, it will no longer be claimable on ethereum, so is re-credited to the originating account. 
//!
//! ## Retiring
//!
//! - Accounts are considered active (not retired) by default.
//! - Any active account can make a signed call to the [`retire`](Pallet::retire_account) extrinsic to change their status to
//!   retired.
//! - Only active accounts should be included as active bidders for the auction.
//!
//! ## Account creation and deletion
//!
//! - When a staker adds stake for the first time, this creates an account.
//! - When a user claims all remaining funds, their account is deleted.
//!
