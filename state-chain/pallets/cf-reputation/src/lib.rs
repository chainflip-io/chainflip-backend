//! # ChainFlip Reputation Module
//!
//! A module to manage the reputation of our validators for the ChainFlip State Chain
//!
//! - [`Config`]
//! - [`Call`]
//! - [`Module`]
//!
//! ## Overview
//! The module contains functionality to measure the liveness of our validators.  This is measured
//! with a *heartbeat* which should be submitted via the extrinsic `heartbeat()` within the time
//! period set by the *heartbeat interval*.  By continuing to submit heartbeats the validator will
//! earn *online credits*.  These *online credits* are exchanged for *reputation points*
//! when they have been *online* for a specified period.  *Reputation points* buffer the validator
//! from being slashed when they go offline for a period of time.
//!
//! Penalties in terms of reputation points are incurred when any one of the *offline conditions* are
//! met.  Falling into negative reputation leads to the eventual slashing of FLIP.  As soon as reputation
//! is positive slashing stops.
//!
//! ## Terminology
//! - **Validator:** A node in our network that is producing blocks.
//! - **Heartbeat:** A term used to measure the liveness of a validator.
//! - **Heartbeat interval:** The duration in time, measured in blocks we would expect to receive a
//!   *heartbeat* from a validator.
//! - **Online:** A node that is online has successfully submitted a heartbeat during the current
//!   heartbeat interval.
//! - **Offline:** A node that is considered offline when they have *not* submitted a heartbeat during
//!   the last heartbeat interval.
//! - **Online credits:** A credit accrued by being continuously online which inturn is used to earn.
//!   *reputation points*.  Failing to stay *online* results in losing all of their *online credits*.
//! - **Reputation points:** A point system which allows validators to earn reputation by being *online*.
//!   They lose reputation points by being meeting one of the *offline conditions*.
//! - **Offline conditions:** One of the following conditions: *missed heartbeat*, *failed to broadcast
//!   an output*, *failed to participate in a signing ceremony*, *not enough performance credits* and
//!   *contradicting self during signing ceremony*.  Each condition has its associated penalty in
//!   reputation points.
//! - **Slashing:** The process of debiting FLIP tokens from a validator.  Slashing only occurs in this
//!   pallet when a validator's reputation points fall below zero *and* they are *offline*.
//! - **Accrual Ratio:** A ratio of reputation points earned per number of offline credits
//!
