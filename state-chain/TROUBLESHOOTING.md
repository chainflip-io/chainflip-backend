# Substrate Troubleshooting

This is a living document with tips, gotchas and general subtrate-related wizardry. If you ever get stuck with an incomprehensible compiler error, before spending the day turning in circles, come here first and see if someone else has already encountered the same issue. 

Please add anything you think will save your colleagues' precious time. 

If you come across anything that is inaccurate or incomplete, please edit the document accordingly. 

As of yet there is no real structure - this isn't intended to be a document to read from start to finish, it's not a tutorial. But your entries should be searchable, so write your entries with SEO in mind.
