# Justification

The intention of this document is to ensure the team makes decisions, work can move forward, and the team members are comfortable with those decisions, even when the members initially do not agree.

# Location

We choose to document our practices here inside this repository, so they are easily assessible and we can use Github's source control tools to manage the maintainence of this document.

# Requirements

Our practices must be:
- As unambiguous as possible. It should be clear how and when the practice applies. If necessary they should include clarifying examples. Ideally these examples would be from our codebase, and include links to PRs and issues.
- Well-reasoned. Otherwise we will likely alienate some developers. As such each practice should be justified using logic, principles, ideals, and other practices.

# Maintainence

Create an issue on this repository regarding the modification to / problem with the practices, provide a justification for the change, and add the <span style="color:rgb(0,255,0)">practices</span> label. We intentionally chose not to burden ourselves with a formal process to agree on modifications to the practices, but it is expected the whole team be given the opportinity to comment, a majority of the team should agree to a change, and those who disagreed are satisfied with the resolution. Once the modification is agreed on by the team, create a pull request to modify this document. That pull request should contain changes that ensure the codebase matches the new practices if applicable.

# Application

It is expected we "disagree and commit" with the contents of this document. If you feel a particular practice should be changed, you should still follow the practice until the team agrees to a change.

These practices should be used to help resolve disagreements. If that is not possible, the disagreement should be escalated so it can be resolved. If possible the resolution should result in modifcations to this document.
