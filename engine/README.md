- Interfacing with the State Chain to gather and respond to events emitted by the chain
- Witness events occurring on other chains by monitoring particular addresses
- Submitting data from other chains back to the State Chain for consensus purposes
- Provide an endpoint to allow for monitoring services to check it's online
