# Configuration for the Zepter CLI to ensure correct feature configuration in the Rust workspace.
# <https://crates.io/crates/zepter>
#
# `cargo install zepter -f --locked` to install the CLI.
#
# Then `zepter check` to check the workspace and `zepter` to fix the issues.

    It looks like one more more Zepter feature checks failed; please check the console output.
    You can try to automatically address them by running `zepter`.
