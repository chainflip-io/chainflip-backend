# chainflip-bouncer

The chainflip-bouncer is a set of end-to-end testing scripts that can be used to
run various scenarios against a deployed chainflip chain. Currently it only supports
localnets.

## Installation / Setup

You need [NodeJS](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) and JQ
on your machine:

```sh
brew install jq
```

You will need to create a personal access token in GitHub with the
`read:packages` scope to access our internally published packages and create the
following `.npmrc` file at your user home directory (`~/.npmrc`):

```
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=ghp_YOUR-AUTH-TOKEN-HERE
@chainflip-io:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
```

Then you need to install the dependencies:

```sh
cd bouncer
npm install -g pnpm
pnpm install
```

Note: If npm does not install outdated version of pnpm, you can use corepack to install the latest version:
`corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate`

Now you can use the provided scripts, assuming that a localnet is already running on your machine.
To connect to a remote network such as a Devnet, you need to set the following environment variables:

```bash
 export CF_NODE_ENDPOINT=
 export POLKADOT_ENDPOINT=
 export BTC_ENDPOINT=
 export ETH_ENDPOINT=
 export BROKER_ENDPOINT=
 ...
```

The values for your network can be found in the `eth-contracts` vault in 1Password.
