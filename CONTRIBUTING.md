# How to contribute

Currently, the Chainflip project is actively being developed by a dedicated team of programmers at Chainflip Labs. However, we are grateful for any contribution. Given the complexity of the codebase and the potentially huge consequences of bugs, we typically keep a list of issues that can be solved/implemented without a deep knowledge of the system and are thus suitable for newcomers.
Please contact us on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/chainflip-community) if you are serious about wanting to contribute to this project.
