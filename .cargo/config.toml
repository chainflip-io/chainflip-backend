# The `cf-audit` command is configured to ignore the following advisories:
# Vulnerabilities:
# - RUSTSEC-2022-0093: This advisory is related to ed25519-dalek's public api design, which we don't expose.
# - RUSTSEC-2023-0052: This advisory comes from webpki, a dependency of ethers-rs. CPU denial of service in certificate path building. We don't use this functionality.
# Unsound:
# - RUSTSEC-2021-0145: This advisory only affects the windows platform. It's a transitive dependency of `substrate`.
# Unmaintained:
# - RUSTSEC-2020-0168: This advisory comes from `mach`, which is unmaintained but not a security issue. It's a dependency of `subxt`.
# - RUSTSEC-2021-0059: This is a transitive dependency of libp2p and will be fixed in an upcoming release.
# - RUSTSEC-2021-0060: This is a transitive dependency of libp2p and will be fixed in an upcoming release.
# - RUSTSEC-2021-0139: This advisory comes from `ansi_term`, which is unmaintained but not a security issue. It's a dependency of `subxt`.
# - RUSTSEC-2022-0061: This advisory is related to the deprecated `parity-wasm`, not a security issue. It's a dependency of `substrate`.
# - RUSTSEC-2023-0074: Related to zerocopy, this is a transitive dependency. We can update this when we update substrate.
