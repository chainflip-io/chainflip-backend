# - RUSTSEC-2023-0023, RUSTSEC-2023-0022, RUSTSEC-2023-0024: These advisories come from `openssl`, an indirect dependency of `web3`.
# - RUSTSEC-2020-0071: This advisory is related to a potential segmentation fault in the `time` crate, a dependency of `substrate`.
# - RUSTSEC-2021-0139: This advisory comes from `ansi_term`, which is unmaintained but not a security issue. It's a dependency of `subxt`.
# - RUSTSEC-2020-0168: This advisory comes from `mach`, which is unmaintained but not a security issue. It's a dependency of `subxt`.
